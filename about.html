		<h1>About SACRC</h1>
		<p>
			Located on the East Side of the San Francisco, California Bay Area, SACRC was first incorporated in 1967 and holds AMA Club Charter #162. Like many clubs across the country we have lost a few sites over the years but we would like to think that we have been upgrading. Meetings are generally held the 2nd Saturday of the month at the field at 11AM. Please check the main web page for verification of time and location.
